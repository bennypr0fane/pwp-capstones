- I slightly modified the populate.py file from the original download at Codecademy -
running TomeRater with the original file will produce errors!
- The `schnipsel` folder just contains parts of the code where I was trying out alternatives or first drafts. You're welcome to comment, but it's not part of the project.
- running the populate-py file on my computer produces a type error with the Geany IDE v 1.29 - it compiles fine, however, when running it from Spyder IDE v 3.3.3. I haven't gotten to the bottom of this issue yet.
